## Basic implementation of an MLP using Theano

This implementation closely matches the one found in the theano tutorial. 
I've added some convenience featues, such as object oriented stochastic gradient descent (inspired by now deprecated Pylearn2) and datasets. 

## Requirements

- NumPy
- Theano 

## Usage 

Nada yet.
